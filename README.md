[Dev Log: Candle Flame Tracker](https://same-alibi-a55.notion.site/Dev-Log-Candle-Controlled-Joystick-Interface-135594e3858c80a3b57ce9d96a4dd224?pvs=74)

## Overview

This project uses computer vision to track candle flame movements and visualize their position and motion patterns, creating an interactive way to observe flame dynamics.

## Features

- Real-time flame tracking using OpenCV
- Position and movement visualization
- Configurable detection parameters
- Interactive display window

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Webcam
- Candle (and safe setup for use)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Configure your webcam setup

## Usage

1. Set up your candle in a stable, safe location
2. Position your webcam to clearly view the flame
3. Run the tracking software:
   ```bash
   python flambe2.py
   ```
4. Adjust parameters using the on-screen controls
5. Press 'q' to quit the application


## Safety Considerations

- Never leave burning candles unattended
- Keep flammable materials away from the candle
- Ensure proper ventilation
- Follow all local fire safety regulations
